A virtual environment (venv) is an independent python machine + python 
library that is separate from the "main" python on your computer and other
venvs which allows for projects to be separate from eachother.

To activate the venv, launch the .bat file with "venv/Scripts/Activate" (win).

To deactivate, type the command "deactivate".

To install Flask, type "pip install Flask" in the venv.

To run the server instance locally, type "flask --app [filename] run".
You can now go to localhost:5000 in a browser to connect. This is
a bulletin server, so maybe not the best for final project. 

To run the server instance on your network: "flask --app [filename] run -- host=0.0.0.0"
To visit it from another computer on the network, go to localhost:5000.
It will tell you the IP address, and you can navigate there from other connected
devices! 

Debug mode automatically refreshes the server when code is changed.
To run in debug mode: "flask --app [filename] --debug run"
